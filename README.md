# WTF Is My Psychology Experiment?

Inspired by [WhatTheFuckShouldIMakeForDinner.com](http://whatthefuckshouldimakefordinner.com/), [WhatTheFuckIsMyMashup.com](http://whatthefuckismymashup.com/) and the [WTFEngine](https://github.com/soulwire/WTFEngine/).


## How it works

The process is very simple. The WTF Engine takes a sentence template and fills in different types of blanks with different types of words, much like the game [Mad Libs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs). You can nominate any amount of templates and as many different categories of words or phrases as you like.

For example, here is a basic corpus

    {
        template: [ "Big @color @animal", "Silly @animal with @color fur" ],
        animal: [ "dog", "cat", "rabbit" ],
        color: [ "red", "blue", "green", "yellow" ]
    };
    
As you can see, in a template you use the __@__ symbol, followed by the type of word you wish to use to tell the WTF Engine to pick a random word of that type from the corpus and insert it at that point.

## Notes

This was written simply as a bit of fun. Zach's site was so popular that it inspired references based on other subjects, such as [What The Fuck Is My Social Media Strategy?](http://whatthefuckismysocialmediastrategy.com) (and consequently [What The Fuck Is My Mashup?](http://whatthefuckismymashup.com/)). As far as I am aware, this idea was Zach's alone and so credit to him for the inspiration. As a meme, there are doubtlessly many topics that could do with the WTF treatment; which is why I decided to create this (very) simple platform.
